<span class="post"><span class="timestamp">15 Jul 2025, 22:30</span><br>I finally received my APS certificate â€” a
    mandatory document verification issued by the Academic Evaluation Centre (APS India), required for applying to
    German universities.<br>Class 10 Board Clarification<ol>
        <li>My Class 10 certificate was originally issued by the Board of Secondary Education, Andhra Pradesh, before
            the 2014 state bifurcation, when Andhra Pradesh was split into Telangana and residual Andhra Pradesh.</li>
        <li>After the split, Telangana established its own education board, now called the Board of Secondary Education,
            Telangana State, which legally inherited all academic records from the Telangana region.</li>
        <li>Since my schooling was in Telangana, my certificate is now maintained by this board and is available
            digitally via DigiLocker â€” a secure government platform for issuing and storing official documents online.
        </li>
        <li>Initially, my Class 10 wasn't verified by APS due to its unavailability on DigiLocker.</li>
        <li>After escalation, it became available, and APS has now correctly updated my certificate to reflect the
            Telangana board.</li>
    </ol><br>âœ… APS done. On to the next step in the ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª journey!<br>#APS #DigiLocker #GermanyBound #TelanganaBoard
